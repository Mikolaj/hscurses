hscurses is a Haskell binding to the NCurses library, a library of
functions that manage an application's display on character-cell
terminals. Additionally, it contains some basic widgets such as
a text input widget and a table widget.

The HSCurses library has been reported to work on Linux x86 and OpenBSD
using GHC 6.2 and 6.4.


Building and installing the HSCurses library:
---------------------------------------------

Requirements:

- GNU make
- GNU m4
- GHC >= 6.2

Build and installation steps:

  ./configure
  make
  make install      # probably as root
  make register     # probably as root

In order to generate the API documentation, you need haddock
(http://www.haskell.org/haddock). The command is then:

  make doc          # result goes to ./html


Using the HSCurses library:
---------------------------

Just add the flag `-package hscurses' to the compiler flags. At the
moment, user documentation is only available through Haddock API
documentation.
