hscurses is a Haskell binding to the NCurses library, a library of
functions that manage an application's display on character-cell
terminals. hscurses also provides some basic widgets implemented on
top of the ncurses binding, such as a text input widget and a table
widget.

The hscurses library has been reported to work on Linux x86 and on
OpenBSD using GHC 6.2 and 6.4.


Building and installing the hscurses library:
---------------------------------------------

Requirements:

- GNU make
- GNU m4
- GHC >= 6.2

Build and installation steps:

  sh configure
  make
  make doc          # if you want to build the API documentation
  make install      # probably as root
  make register     # probably as root

In order to generate the API documentation, you need haddock
(http://www.haskell.org/haddock). The command is then:

  make doc          # result goes to ./html


Using the hscurses library:
---------------------------

Just add the flag `-package hscurses' to the compiler flags. At the
moment, user documentation is only available through Haddock API
documentation.

History:
--------

John Meacham started the binding for his chat client Ginsu
(http://repetae.net/john/computer/ginsu/).

Tuomo Valkonen integrated to code into Riot
(http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/riot/), with minor modifications.

Don Stewart improved the code for the Yi editor
(http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/yi.html).

Stefan Wehr turned the binding into a standalone library. He also
added some basic widgets.
