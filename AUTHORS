John Meacham (john at repetae dot net) started the binding for his
chat client Ginsu (http://repetae.net/john/computer/ginsu/).

Tuomo Valkonen (tuomov at iki.fi) integrated to code into Riot
(http://modeemi.fi/~tuomov/riot/), with minor modifications.

Don Stewart (http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons) improved the code for
the Yi editor (http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~dons/yi.html).

Stefan Wehr (http://www.stefanwehr.de) turned the binding into a
standalone library. He also added some basic widgets.
